# Pulse - Nurse Productivity & Task Management Prototype

Pulse is a mobile-first productivity and task management application designed specifically for ICU and Trauma nurses. It aims to streamline workflow by organizing tasks, alerts, and team communication in a unified, intuitive interface.

## ⚠️ Prototype Disclaimer

**This application is a conceptual prototype.**

*   **Concept Only**: This serves as a proof-of-concept to illustrate the core ideas and workflow.
*   **Design Status**: The current User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) are **not confirmed**. The visual design is a placeholder to demonstrate functionality and is subject to change in future iterations.

## Key Features (Concept)

*   **Timeline View**: A chronological feed of tasks and alerts.
*   **Smart Gestures**: Swipe right to complete tasks, swipe left to snooze.
*   **Delegation System**: Quickly delegate tasks to other staff members.
*   **Team Chat**: Integrated messaging with staff status indicators.
*   **Mobile-First Constraint**: Designed strictly for mobile viewports to simulate the intended device experience.
